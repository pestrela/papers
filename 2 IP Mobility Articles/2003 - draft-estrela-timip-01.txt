Abstract 
    
   All IP mobility protocols currently proposed on the IETF assume that 
   the mobile nodes always have a mobility-aware IP stack, which is 
   still a scenario that can seldom be found nowadays. Most terminals, 
   including the laptops and PDAs which most would benefit of the 
   mobility support, still use legacy IP stacks, limiting their use to 
   layer-2 mobility within a single IP subnet.  
   This document presents Terminal Independent Mobile IP (TIMIP), which 
   supports IP micro-mobility of all possible existing legacy IP 
   terminals, while fully interoperating with Mobile IP to provide 
   macromobility across IP subnets for all terminals.

2. Introduction 
    
   All IP mobility protocols currently proposed on the IETF assume that 
   the mobile nodes always have a mobility-aware IP stack, which is 
   still a scenario that can seldom be found nowadays. Most terminals, 
   including the laptops and PDAs which most would benefit of the 
   mobility support, still use legacy IP stacks, limiting their use to 
   layer-2 mobility within a single IP subnet.  
    
   Currently, there exists evidence that the need of special mobile 
   stacks for the terminals may be holding the generalization of this 
   service, because of the effort needed to change the already existing 
   IP terminals for the new technology. Particularly, this need has 
   already been identified regarding the IP mobility deployment in 
   wireless technologies (see section 4, “Registration requests 
   generated on behalf of a mobile node” of [8]). 
    
   TIMIP [1] is a micromobility architecture that allows Mobile Nodes 
   with legacy IP stacks to roam within an IP domain, thus enabling the 
   IP mobility of all existing IP terminals, by explicitly not 
   requiring any processing related to the mobility service on the 
   mobile terminals. Between TIMIP domains, the movement of the 
   terminals is supported with custom macromobility mechanisms based on 
   and fully compatible with standard Mobile IP [2].

   Internet-draft        Terminal Independent             January 2003 
                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   The main features of TIMIP are listed below, which includes both 
   novel and similar features of other micromobility architectures, 
   namely CIP [3] and HAWAII [4]: 
    
   - TIMIP does not require changes to the IP protocol stack of mobile 
     nodes, for both micromobility or macromobility support, thus 
     supporting any existing IP terminal. 
   - TIMIP specifically promotes the use of data link layer information 
     for terminal power-up and movement detection on the network side, 
     for detection performance. When the layer-2 does not offer 
     sufficient information, a generic handoff detection algorithm is 
     used. 
   - Refreshing of routing paths is performed by data packets sent by 
     the mobile terminals, with refreshing being employed only when no 
     traffic is detected at the routers for a certain time interval 
     (similar to CIP). 
   - Routing reconfiguration during handoff within a TIMIP domain only 
     needs to change the routing tables of the Access Routers located 
     in the shortest path between the Access Points involved (similar 
     to HAWAII). 
   - Routing of data packets within a TIMIP domain does not need to 
     reach the Access Network Gateway, involving only the Access 
     Routers located in the shortest path between the sender and the 
     receiver (similar to HAWAII). 
    
    
3. Applicability 
    
   TIMIP is applicable within LANs, and possibly larger networks up to 
   IP domains, that form one subnet only. To provide mobility between 
   subnets (macromobility), Mobile IP compatible mechanisms should be 
   present on the Access Network Gateway of each TIMIP domain. 
    
   It is expected that the data link layer of the Access Points is able 
   to perform terminal power-up and movement detection, and able to 
   notify the TIMIP layer. If this facility is not available, a simple 
   handoff detection algorithm is used. 
    
   It is also assumed that the Access Routers of the TIMIP domain form 
   a logical tree, with the Access Network Gateway located at the top. 
    
    
4. Terminology 
    
   Access Network 
   An IP network that includes one or more Access Routers, and an 
   Access Network Gateway. 
    
   Access Network Gateway (ANG) 
   An Access Router that separates the Access Network from a third 
   party network. 
    
   Access Point (AP)

   Internet-draft        Terminal Independent             January 2003 
                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   An Access Router that offers layer-2 connectivity to Mobile Nodes. 
   This layer-2 can be based on any possible technology, and is 
   depicted in this document, without loss of generality, as a wireless 
   link, as this kind of access is the most interesting one for the use 
   of mobility mechanisms. 
    
   Access Router (AR) 
   An IP router residing in an Access Network and connected to one or 
   more access routers. An AR offers connectivity to Mobile Nodes by 
   means of IP routing. The router may include intelligence beyond 
   simple forwarding service offered by ordinary IP routers. Some 
   Access Routers can be Access Points, and one of them is the ANG. 
    
   Legacy Mobile Node (LMN) 
   A Mobile Node whose IP layer is not aware of mobility. The precise 
   requirements of the LMNs are the ones necessary for Internet Hosts, 
   described in [9]. 
    
   Mobile Node (MN) 
   An IP end-node capable of changing its point of attachment to the 
   network. 
    
   Subnet 
   A range of IP addresses sharing a common prefix. 
    
    
5. Architecture 
    
   A TIMIP domain is an IP subnet organized as a logical tree of Access 
   Routers (ARs) whose root router is the Access Network Gateway (ANG). 
   The Access Routers can also be layer-2 Access Points (APs), which 
   interface directly with the MNs through the wireless medium (WM). 
   The architectural diagram of TIMIP is depicted in Figure 1.

   As a Legacy Mobile Node (LMN) has a legacy IP stack and cannot issue 
   any signaling during handoff, handoff detection by the AR relies on 
   notification from layer-2, or from a Generic Detection Algorithm. 
   This notification triggers routing reconfiguration of the TIMIP 
   domain, leading to routing table updating at the ARs. 
    
    
6.  Registration 
    
   In order to allow attachment of an LMN to a TIMIP domain, the LMN 
   must be previously registered at the ANG. This is accomplished 
   offline through management procedures, or automatically using the 
   DHCP protocol (see section 11). For each LMN recognized in a TIMIP 
   domain, registration information consists on the following: 
    
   - MAC address of the LMN; 
   - IP Address of the LMN; 
   - MIP capability; 
   - IP address of the MIP Home Agent; 
   - Authentication Key; 
   - Authentication option.

   Internet-draft        Terminal Independent             January 2003 
                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   The MIP capability parameter specifies if MIP is required, either 
   implemented at the ANG on behalf of legacy terminal (surrogate MIP) 
   or implemented at the terminal itself. If the terminal has a legacy 
   IP protocol stack, the next two parameters specify respectively the 
   IP address of its Home Agent and the authentication key to be used 
   between the terminal and the ANG when the authentication option is 
   turned on. It should be noted that TIMIP authentication is mandatory 
   for macromobility scenarios for both MIP and legacy terminals. The 
   IP address of the Home Agent is not used when the terminal 
   implements MIP, as the terminal itself is responsible for 
   registering with the Home Agent, bypassing the ANG. 
    
   Once this data is configured at the ANG, it is forwarded to the APs 
   (except the authentication key) so that they are able to know the IP 
   address of newly associated terminals based on their MAC address 
   provided by layer-2 as explained below. 
    
    
7. Power-up 
    
   When a terminal firstly appears in a TIMIP domain, a routing path is 
   created along the hierarchy of ARs. Consider the scenario in 
   Figure 1. When the MN attaches itself to AR1, the creation of the 
   routing path takes the following steps: 
    
   1. The MT performs a layer-2 association with an AP that belongs to 
      the local TIMIP domain. 
    
   2. At the AP, the IP layer is notified about the presence of the MT 
      in its wireless interface, by means of a primitive containing the 
      detected MAC address of the terminal, triggering the routing 
      reconfiguration procedure. This primitive can be generated 
      exclusively by the Layer-2 itself, or by a Generic Detection 
      Algorithm to be described later. 
      When this happens, the MAC address is matched against the 
      terminal registration information broadcasted by the ANG and the 
      respective IP address is found. As the New AP has currently no 
      routing table entry for the MT, the routing table is updated with 
      the addition of this new entry. 
    
   3. The New AP sends a TIMIP RoutingUpdate message up to the AR at 
      hierarchical level 2. This AR acknowledges with a 
      RoutingUpdateAck message, and updates its routing table 
      accordingly with the addition of a new entry relative to the MT. 
      This entry points to the source of the RoutingUpdate message – 
      the AP1 - in order to specify the path through which the terminal 
      can be reached.

                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   4. Exchange of RoutingUpdate/RoutingUpdateAck messages climbs up the 
      hierarchy levels. At each level, the routing table is updated 
      with the creation of a new entry relative to the MT. This entry 
      always points to the source of the RoutingUpdate message in order 
      to specify the path through which the MT can be reached, by means 
      of the next node information for each terminal. 
 
   5. Exchange of RoutingUpdate/RoutingUpdateAck messages reaches the 
      ANG, completing the creation of the new routing path. 
    
   The MT is now reachable through the routing path established by the 
   above procedures. The ARs that do not belong to this path have no 
   routing entry for the MT. At these ARs, all packets destined to the 
   MT are forwarded up the hierarchy of routers by default. All packets 
   that arrive at an AR whose routing table has an entry to the 
   destination, are forwarded down the hierarchy of routers until they 
   reach the radio interface in which the MT is located. As thus, for 
   packets destined to a terminal located in the same TIMIP domain as 
   the source (intra-domain traffic), only in the worst case reach the 
   ANG. 
    
   The RoutingUpdate messages are coupled with their respective 
   RoutingUpdateAck to ensure that the network is able to have the 
   correct localization information of the LMNs, even when these 
   signalization messages are lost. As thus, when a node does not 
   receive the acknowledge message of an update within a certain amount 
   of time (default 1 second), it automatically resends its update 
   message to the peer. These messages include a timestamp generated at 
   the New AP on the moment of detection (primitive reception). As in 
   TIMIP all APs are synchronized by means of the Network Time Protocol 
   (NTP) [5], this guarantees consistency even when the MT moves faster 
   than the route reconfiguration, because  
    
   It should also be noted that the routing path is soft-state and 
   after its establishment, it is refreshed by the data packets sent by 
   the LMN, being sufficient to be received for routing through the 
   interface that the terminal is registered. Using this facility, the 
   state maintaining of active terminals does not add any overhead. 
    
   Nevertheless, as the packets are routed within the TIMIP domain, 
   some of the ARs may not be refreshed. When this occurs, the routing 
   entry for the MT becomes invalid after a predefined timeout, that is 
   subject to a backoff procedure. The AR where the timer expired 
   starts to send ICMP EchoRequest messages to the terminal, filling 
   the source address field of the IP header with the IP address of the 
   ANG. This forces the MT to reply with EchoReply messages destined to 
   the ANG, which will refresh all the routing path within the TIMIP 
   domain. 
   If this Reply message is properly received with the current timeout, 
   then its value is doubled, up to a predefined maximum; on the other 
   hard, if no reply is received, then the value is divided by two up 
   to a predefined minimum, that forces the routing entry for the LMN 
   to be removed.

                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
    
   This basic TIMIP configuration is adequate to have micromobility in 
   wireless access networks where security is not an issue. 
   Nevertheless, just like in other unprotected IP networks, it allows 
   MTs to power-on with false MAC and IP addresses. In order to avoid 
   this, a minimal security functionality must be implemented at the MT 
   itself. However, this can be done in the application layer with no 
   need to change the IP protocol stack. When the authentication option 
   is used, it is assumed that the MT runs a special security 
   application that uses a database of authentication keys for the 
   different TIMIP domains in which the MT is allowed to power-up. This 
   database is indexed by the IP addresses of the ANGs that are the 
   root of the respective networks. 
    
   The authentication takes place in step 2 of the power-on procedure, 
   immediately after layer-2 notifies the IP layer of the AP about the 
   association of the MT. The AP sends an SignatureRequest message to a 
   well known UDP port in the MT. This message carries <IP address of 
   the MT, IP address of the ANG, rand, timestamp>, where rand is a 
   random value and the timestamp is an NTP formatted 64-bit value. The 
   same message is sent to the ANG.  
    
   Both the MT and the ANG answer the AP with a SignatureReply message 
   containing the same fields present in the SignatureRequest message, 
   plus its 128-bit MD5 message digest [6] calculated with the 
   authentication key of the MT for this network. The latter is only 
   known by the MT (based on the authentication key database and the IP 
   address of the ANG) and the ANG (based on the registration 
   information). The AP compares the signatures of the two 
   SignatureReply messages, and proceeds with the routing 
   reconfiguration procedures only in case there is a match.

   subnetwork is depicted in Figure 2.

                      Figure 2: Handoff between APs. 
    
    
   For the Handoff procedure, the first four steps are the exact same 
   as the Power-up case. The remaining steps are the following: 
    
   5. Exchange of RoutingUpdate/RoutingUpdateAck messages climbs up the 
      hierarchy levels, until the crossover AR (the AR that belongs 
      simultaneously to the old path and to the new path) is reached 
      (in the example above, node AR5). Now that the new routing path 
      is completely created, the old path must be deleted. This 
      procedure starts when the crossover AR sends a RoutingUpdate 
      message addressed to the MT through the old routing path. The AR 
      that receives the message realizes that the MT is no longer 
      accessible through it, updates its routing path by deleting the 
      entry that corresponds to the MT and replies with a 
      RoutingUpdateAck message. 
    
   6. Exchange of RoutingUpdate/RoutingUpdateAck messages goes down the 
      AR tree following the old path, until the Old AP is reached. At 
      each level, the node receives the update from its root peer, and 
      the each routing table is updated by deleting the entry relative 
      to the MT. 
    
   In a normal shared media LAN, when a terminal has a packet destined 
   to an address within the same IP subnet (which is known through the 
   analysis of the IP address prefix), it tries to obtain the MAC 
   address of the destination through an ARP request and send the 
   packet directly to it. In TIMIP, as the APs are also ARs, if the 
   destination is associated to a different AP, the ARP request will 
   never be answered.

                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   In order to prevent this situation, the terminal is forced by 
   configuration (either manually or automatically by DHCP) to send all 
   packets to the IP Gateway of the local subnetwork through it’s 
   current AP. This is accomplished by setting the subnetwork mask 
   configuration to a special value of all bits at “one” 
   (255.255.255.255), and the default GW the current ANG of this AN. 
    
   When the terminal sends an ARP request to obtain the MAC address of 
   the Gateway, the local AP answers with its own MAC address, 
   performing a proxy ARP mechanism on behalf of the ANG (as described 
   on standard MIP procedures [2]), which is sufficient to receive the 
   packets generated on the terminal for subsequent routing with the 
   rules depicted above. 
    
    
9. Macromobility 
    
   TIMIP relies on MIP to support macromobility. The ANG is the HA for 
   MNs whose home network is its TIMIP domain. As LMNs do not implement 
   MIP, the ANG implements all the needed functionality on their 
   behalf. On the other hand, when a foreign MN supports MIP, the ANG 
   acts as a Foreign Agent for the local TIMIP domain. 
    
  9.1. Macromobility for LMNs 
    
   When a MT enters a TIMIP domain different from its current location, 
   the terminal is locally authenticated and a routing path is created 
   between the terminal and the ANG. Packets are then sent/received 
   to/from the outside through the ANG. If the home network of the MT 
   is a different MIP domain, its HA must be notified so that packets 
   can be correctly routed through an IP tunnel established from the HA 
   to the FA located at the ANG. 
    
   After consulting the registration information of the MT (namely the 
   IP address of the HA and the MIP capability), the ANG realizes that 
   it is a foreign MT and that it does not implement MIP. Consequently, 
   the ANG must act as a surrogate MIP element on behalf of the MT, 
   generating all MIP signaling as the MT would (see section 4 of [8]).  
    
   Firstly it has to notify the HA about the MT’s new location and 
   CoAddr by means of a MIP Registration Request message, which 
   requires authentication using the authentication key between the MT 
   and the HA. As the ANG does not know this key, it is the MT that 
   must sign the message. The ANG sends the MT an AuthenticationRequest 
   message containing <IP address of the ANG, IP address of the HA, MIP 
   Registration Request, timestamp> authenticated by the ANG with 
   MD5(K1, AuthenticationRequest), where K1 is the authentication key 
   between the MT and ANG for this TIMIP domain. The MT finds K1 in the 
   key database based on the IP address of the ANG and obtains the 
   authentication key of his home network (K2) in the key database, 
   based on the IP address of the HA.

                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   It then answers with an AuthenticationReply message containing <IP 
   address of the ANG, IP address of the HA, MD5(K2, MIP Registration 
   Request), timestamp>. This message is also authenticated by the 
   terminal with MD5(K1, AuthenticationReply). The ANG can now send a 
   correctly authenticated MIP Registration Request message to the HA 
   adding the message digest provided by the MT as a Mobile-Home 
   Authentication Extension field. 
    
   The HA answers with an authenticated MIP Registration Reply message, 
   which has a message digest MD5(K2, MIP Registration Reply) appended 
   as a Mobile-Home Authentication Extension field. In order to verify 
   the identity of the HA, the ANG must again rely on the MT. It sends 
   an AuthenticationRequest message to the MT, containing <IP address 
   of the ANG, IP address of the HA, MIP Registration Reply (except the 
   Mobile-Home Authentication Extension), timestamp>, authenticated 
   with MD5(K1, Authentication Request).  
    
   The terminal answers with an AuthenticationReply message containing 
   <IP address of the ANG, IP address of the HA, MD5(K2, MIP 
   Registration Reply), timestamp>. If the MD5 digest of the MIP 
   Registration Reply provided by the MT matches that present in the 
   Mobile-Home Authentication Extension of the Registration Reply 
   message sent by the HA, the ANG can resume communication with the 
   HA. 
    
   After the communication with the HA is established, the ANG de-
   encapsulates the tunneled IP packets that come from the HA addressed 
   to the MT and forwards them normally to the MT according to the 
   routing path established in the AR tree. Packets generated by the MT 
   are routed normally according to the same procedures described above 
   for micromobility. In this situation, the subsequent handoff between 
   APs within the foreign TIMIP domain are dealt with TIMIP 
   micromobility procedures only.  
    
   As already seen, all traffic that crosses the boundary of the TIMIP 
   domain must pass through the ANG, which is the IP Gateway to the 
   core network. Nevertheless, whenever an MT moves to a different 
   domain, the IP address of the ANG changes. In order to keep 
   consistency, the MT would have to change its IP Gateway 
   configuration at each handoff between TIMIP domains, as otherwise 
   the ARP requests to obtain the MAC address of the IP Gateway would 
   not be answered by the APs.  
    
   To address this situation, the MTs are configured with a well-known 
   ANG IP address recognized by all APs of all TIMIP domains. The 
   latter broadcast gratuitous ARP messages associating their own MAC 
   addresses with the well-known ANG IP address each time a terminal 
   performs an association, and performing proxy ARP for this well-
   known ANG IP address as described before. 
    
  9.2. Macromobility for MIP terminals

   Internet-draft        Terminal Independent             January 2003 
                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   When the MT supports MIP but belongs to a different domain, the ANG 
   plays the role of FA. The MT powers-on in the same way as legacy MTs 
   in the TIMIP domain. Once this is completed, the MIP signaling 
   starts. The ANG broadcasts RFC 1256 [7] Router Advertisement 
   messages periodically, specifying its IP address as the MIP CoAddr. 
   In order to haste the process, the MT can request the advertisement 
   by broadcasting a Router Solicitation message, which is then 
   forwarded by the AP to the ANG. 
    
   After the MT receives a Router Advertisement message, it notifies 
   its HA about the CoAddr through the ANG. The HA is then able to 
   forward the incoming packets to the CoAddr through an IP tunnel. The 
   ANG de-encapsulates the IP packets and forwards them normally to the 
   MT according to the routing path established in the AR tree. Packets 
   generated by the MT are also routed normally within the TIMIP 
   domain. Handoff between APs within the foreign TIMIP domain are 
   dealt with TIMIP micromobility procedures only (see above) as the FA 
   is always the same (i.e. the ANG). 
   It should be noted that in this case it is the MT itself that 
   authenticates the MIP messages when communicating with the HA. 
 
    
10. Message Formats 
    
   In this section, we discuss the message formats for the TIMIP  
   messages sent between the ARs of the AN. These messages are sent on 
   standard ICMP protocol, extending it to special usage by the ARs, 
   with a private ICMP_Type that is exclusive for the use of the TIMI 
   Protocol.  
    
   Currently, there is only two message types defined – RoutingUpdate 
   and RoutingUpdateAck – to be used according the procedures outlined 
   on the previous sections.

11. Generic Detection Algorithm 
    
   The primary means of detection of the movements of the terminals is 
   by means of layer-2 information, that can easily be derived from the 
   specific mechanisms of most wireless technologies. However, when 
   TIMIP is to be used in technologies unable to derive such 
   information, a Generic detection procedure is used, that is similar 
   to the well known “MAC learning” algorithm. 
    
   In this method, the AP continuously receives all messages 
   transmitted to the wireless medium, either by promiscuous scanning 
   or other means, receiving the layer-2 MAC frames with the MAC sender 
   information. The AP maintains a cache of known MAC stations present 
   in the area, which  is enough to detect the arrival of a new 
   station. Consequently, when a LMN connects to an AP, the first 
   packet it sends will be interpreted by the AP as an arrival, 
   triggering the primitive that launches the micro-mobility routing 
   procedures. 
    
    
12. DHCP support for automatic registration 
    
   When a LMN is roaming inside an AN, each AP already knows the 
   specific details about this terminal, in particular its MAC and IP 
   addresses. These details can be entered offline trough management 
   procedures, or automatically if the LMN supports the DHCP auto-
   configuration protocol [10]. 
    
   For this feature, the ANG implements a DHCP server that manages the 
   entire IP address pool of this AN, and the remaining ARs implement 
   DHCP relay agents functionality (thus, there exists only one DHCP 
   server per AN). When the terminal enters the TIMIP domain for the 
   first time (see Figure 1), the TIMIP power-up procedure is delayed 
   until the DHCP procedure is completed. This procedure uses the 
   standard DHCP messages (discover, offer, request and ack) through 
   the relay agents as defined in [10], resulting on the automatic 
   assignment of an IP address to the LMN. 
    
   However, the DHCP operation also provides the automatic registration 
   of the terminal on the network. As the LMN identifies itself with 
   his own MAC address, the ANG is able to add a new registration entry 
   to the TIMIP database containing the MAC and IP addresses, and to 
   broadcast this information to all ARs on the network.

                        Mobility for IP (TIMIP) 
    
   This way, after the DHCP, the TIMIP power-up operation is able to be 
   performed as defined above, because all APs will have the necessary 
   information regarding the terminal. It should be noted that the DHCP 
   operation only happens when the terminal firstly enters a IP domain, 
   so that subsequent handoffs between APs within the TIMIP domain are 
   dealt with TIMIP micromobility procedures only (see Figure 2).
