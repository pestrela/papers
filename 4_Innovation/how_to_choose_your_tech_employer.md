Thia image has the crux of his point:

* Start-Up founder: Lots of Fulfillment, good Learning but bad economics
* Pre-product market fit: ont of the worst deals around. You work as much as the founder, but he/she cannot pay you
* HyperGrowth: It cant be better. Please tell me if you know these companies
* Established: a bad deal overall, but fantastic economics
* Lost product market fit: a pretty bad deal. This is where the vast majority of the companies are (even if tye do not appreciate that such is the case for them)
* Going down: an excellent learning experience of what **NOT** to do. An invaluable experience.
